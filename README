TinyBBS by Nicolas Bouliane

TinyBBS is an tiny object-oriented forum. The challenge was to build a fully
working forum in under 150 lines of code. The product was 5kb in weight and keeps
improving while trying to stay as small as possible.

Features:

* Tiny!
* HTML5 compliant
* Protected against XSS and SQL injections

To include the forum in a page, all you need to do is this:
<?php
	require('tinybbs.php');
?>
